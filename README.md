### Objective
Design and develop a comprehensive and user-friendly Student Grade Tracker System that enables efficient management of student information and grades. The system should allow administrators to add, view, and update student records, including marks for various subjects, and provide a simple and intuitive interface for data entry and retrieval. The system should also enable tracking of student progress, calculation of average grades, and identification of areas of improvement. Additionally, the system should ensure data security and integrity, and provide reports and analytics to support informed decision-making, ultimately enhancing the overall educational experience and improving student outcomes.

### Features
- Student Management
- Student Registration: Register new students with their personal and academic details.
- Student Profile Management: View and update student profiles, including contact information and academic history.
- Student Search: Search for students by name, ID, or other criteria.
- Grade Management
- Grade Entry: Allow teachers to enter grades for students in various subjects.
- Grade Calculation: Automatically calculate average grades and GPAs.
- Grade History: View grade history for each student, including past grades and progress.
